# AGENTS.md

Orientation for AI coding agents working **in this repository** (authoring or editing
skills). If you are an end user trying to *use* these skills, see
[`README.md`](README.md) and [`docs/INSTALLATION.md`](docs/INSTALLATION.md) instead.

## What this repo is

An original, cross-engine collection of game-development Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` files)
plus a master router skill. The portable core is the `SKILL.md` open standard.

## Before you write or edit a skill

1. Read [`docs/SKILL-FORMAT.md`](docs/SKILL-FORMAT.md) — the authoring standard.
2. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — the rubric and commit conventions.
3. Check [`docs/skill-catalog.md`](docs/skill-catalog.md) and the existing `skills/` to see
   what is already covered.
4. Start from [`templates/SKILL.template.md`](templates/SKILL.template.md).

## Rules

- **Originality.** Write from primary documentation. Never copy text/code from other
  repos or skill collections — study for patterns only.
- **Spec compliance.** `name` ≤64 chars (lowercase/digits/hyphens, no leading/trailing
  hyphen, equals the folder name). `description` ≤1024 chars and says *what it does and
  when to use it*. Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines; push depth into `references/`.
- **Verify code.** Examples must be correct, idiomatic, and version-pinned. State the
  engine/runtime version. Do not invent APIs.
- **No growth/marketing language** in any committed file.

## Verify before committing

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py
```

Fix every reported failure before you commit. Use conventional commits
(`feat(<category>): …`, `docs: …`, `chore: …`) and stage only the files you changed.

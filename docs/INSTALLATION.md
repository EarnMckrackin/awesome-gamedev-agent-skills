# Installation

How to install these skills into each supported agent. The compatibility details (paths,
triggers, adapters) live in [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](COMPATIBILITY.md); this page is the
practical how-to.

## The one rule

Skills are stored here as:

```
skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md
```

The `<name>/` folder — the direct parent of `SKILL.md` — **is** the skill, and its name equals
the skill's `name`. To install a skill, copy that `<name>/` folder (with its `references/`,
`scripts/`, `assets/` if present) into the agent's skills directory. Skill names are unique
across this repository, so installing every skill into one flat directory is safe.

**Install the router too.** The [`router/`](../router) folder is itself a skill (its `SKILL.md`
is the dispatcher). Copy it in alongside the others so the agent can route requests:
`cp -R router <agent-skills-dir>/router`. The bulk-install snippets below copy everything under
`skills/`; add the router with the extra line shown for Claude Code.

> The examples below use one skill (`godot-tilemap`) and POSIX shell. On Windows PowerShell,
> replace `cp -R src dest` with `Copy-Item -Recurse src dest` and `mkdir -p` with `mkdir`.

## Claude Code

```bash
# project-local
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R skills/godot/godot-tilemap .claude/skills/

# …or every skill (names are globally unique, so flattening is safe)
find skills -name SKILL.md -type f -exec dirname {} \; | while read -r d; do
  cp -R "$d" .claude/skills/
done
cp -R router .claude/skills/router   # the dispatcher — install it too
```

For all projects, copy into `~/.claude/skills/` instead. Claude Code auto-triggers a skill from
its `description`; `/skills` opens an interactive menu.

## Kiro

```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/skills          # or ~/.kiro/skills for global
cp -R skills/godot/godot-tilemap .kiro/skills/
```

The default agent auto-loads skills from both locations. A **custom** agent must opt in via its
`resources`:

```json
{ "name": "my-agent",
  "resources": ["skill://.kiro/skills/*/SKILL.md", "skill://~/.kiro/skills/*/SKILL.md"] }
```

Trigger automatically by description match, or explicitly with `/skill-name`.

## Gemini CLI & Codex CLI (shared location)

Both read `.agents/skills/`, so one copy serves both:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills        # repo-local; or ~/.agents/skills for user-global
cp -R skills/godot/godot-tilemap .agents/skills/
```

- **Gemini CLI:** verify with `gemini skills list` or `/skills`; activation prompts for consent.
- **Codex CLI:** list with `/skills`, or mention `$godot-tilemap`; implicit activation by
  description also works.

## Claude Agent SDK (Python)

Skills are filesystem artifacts under `.claude/skills/`; load them by setting
`setting_sources`:

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    cwd="/path/to/project",                 # contains .claude/skills/
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],    # REQUIRED, or no skills are discovered
    skills="all",                           # or ["godot-tilemap", ...]
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Bash", "Skill"],
)
```

## Claude.ai

1. Settings → Capabilities → enable **Code execution**.
2. Zip the skill folder so that the folder (named exactly like `name`) is the zip root and
   `SKILL.md` sits inside it.
3. Customize → Skills → **Upload**.

Keep `description` ≤ 200 characters so it is not truncated by the upload UI.

## Cursor / Windsurf / Cline (generated adapters)

These editors use rules files rather than `SKILL.md`, so a skill is converted to the editor's
rule format (see the mapping in [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](COMPATIBILITY.md)). The adapter generator
is delivered with the tooling sessions; the intended interface is:

```bash
scripts/adapters/generate-rules --target cursor   --out .cursor/rules
scripts/adapters/generate-rules --target windsurf --out .windsurf/rules
scripts/adapters/generate-rules --target cline    --out .clinerules
```

Until then, a skill can be adapted by hand: create the rule file at the path in the matrix,
copy the `SKILL.md` body in, and (for Cline) prepend the `description` to the body so the model
still sees what the skill is and when to use it.

## Verify after installing

Open your agent and confirm the skill is listed (e.g. `/skills` in Claude Code, Kiro, Codex, or
Gemini). Then ask a question that should trigger it — for `godot-tilemap`, something like
"set up a tilemap with autotiling in Godot" — and confirm the skill activates.
